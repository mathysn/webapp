# Welcome to my project
This project has the goal of teaching me how back-end development works, and it will also become my personal website.

## Technology used
- Node.js / Express.js
- SQL
- EJS (as a replacement for HTML)
- CSS
- Native JS

## Content
Since this will eventually be my personal website, it will contain stuff like my CV, portfolio and other random things that I will create in the future, maybe even a blog or forums, who knows...
